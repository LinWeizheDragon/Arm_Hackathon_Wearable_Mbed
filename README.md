## Functions
Our Mbed board works as a wearable device, which collects the acceleration data of the user and applies machine learning model to tell which state the user is currently in (idle, walking, running, typing on laptop...). The collected data can be recorded and be used to provide an overview of the user's daily activity. The user can understand the daily pattern of a day and notice how his/her daily pattern is being changed. For example, the less and less sleeping time will warm them to adjust their habits at night.

## Note
This project relies on Mbed device provided by Arm Hackthon
